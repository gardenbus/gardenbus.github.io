Telling people about new growing technologies is one thing, but we all know how disconnected from food production can be. Just how things work now can be alien to most people. Eyes glaze over.

What? Are we expecting to change hearts and minds with agriculture, economics and political science lectures? No.

The way to win hearts, have great conversations, win friends and influence people starts with sharing something satisfying. Something neat or even something tasty perhaps. Everyone is trying to take your attention, but those you are drawn to are those showing you something neat, something hypothetically useful, even if only a thing you can tell other people about. The Garden Bus can seriously do it all!

First, building it will bring together foodies, chefs, veterans, engineers, artists from all across the spectrum. Breaking the ordinary barriers and divisions between us by building something together.

Second, showing it off will bring even more people together: students and teachers, parents and children, chefs and foodies, businesses and customers.

There's something to this idea...
